Cumberland High School's 1st Game!

## Information

After a long day at school, you stop by a local arcade to unwind, drawn by the challenge of beating the impossible high score of 9999 in Deformed Cat Tetris. But as the final block falls into place, something strange happens: the arcade lights flicker, the screen glows, and you get pulled into the game itself! You soon realize that you must conquer a series of minigames to return to reality. With time ticking and the stakes rising, you must rely on wit, strategy, and determination to beat the games and escape. Will you succeed, or will you be trapped in the digital world forever?
